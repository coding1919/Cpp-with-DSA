// Sorting is the process of arranging data in a particular order, such as increasing or decreasing

// it is used in many real world application like students name list or students height during assembly

// arr = | 3 | 8 | 1 | 2 | 5 |

// ascending order (increasing order):
// arr = | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 |
// decending order (decreasing order):
// arr = | 8 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

// by sorting,  search process becomes easier
